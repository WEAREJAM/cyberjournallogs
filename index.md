### I'm JAM

Cybersecurity enthusiast, bug bounty learner, and ethical hacker in progress.  
Through this blog, I document everything I break (legally ðŸ˜‰), learn, and build.  
Tools I love: Burp Suite, OWASP BWA, Kali Linux, DVWA.  
This is where my curiosity and persistence meet. Let's grow together.

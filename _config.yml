  CyberJournal Logs â€“ an evolving knowledge base on ethical hacking, bug bounty, and secure development.
  Where code meets curiosity, and every vulnerability unfolds a lesson.
  I believe persistence is the true power of every cyber warrior.

  These logs are more than just dry theory â€” they're a real-world guide for anyone walking the path from zero to root.
  Join me for hands-on tips, practical tricks, and sharp insights that make cybersecurity simple, direct, and worth every byte.

    I'm JAM â€” cybersecurity enthusiast, bug bounty learner, and ethical hacker in progress.
    Through this blog, I document everything I break (legally ðŸ˜‰), learn, and build.
    Tools I love: Burp Suite, OWASP BWA, Kali Linux, DVWA.
    This is where my curiosity and persistence meet. Let's grow together.

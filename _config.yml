# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.

# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

CyberJournal Logs â€“ an evolving knowledge base on ethical hacking, bug bounty, and secure development.
Where code meets curiosity, and every vulnerability unfolds a lesson.
I believe persistence is the true power of every cyber warrior.

These logs are more than just dry theory â€” they're a real-world guide for anyone walking the path from zero to root.
Join me for hands-on tips, practical tricks, and sharp insights that make cybersecurity simple, direct, and worth every byte.

Through this blog, I document everything I break (legally ðŸ˜‰), learn, and build.  
Tools I love: Burp Suite, OWASP BWA, Kali Linux, DVWA.
This is where my curiosity and persistence meet. Let's grow together."
